# UTM Digital Open Day — Visit Summary
**Date:** 28 September 2025

## Summary
I attended the UTM Digital Open Day to explore the UTM Digital section and its services. It was an eye-opening experience — I learned about the UTM student portal, the UTM Smart app, and attended a talk on Data Engineering.

## Highlights
- Overview of UTM digital services and student-facing apps
- Data Engineering talk that provided practical insights
- Multiple booths showcasing technologies and services
- The D RON booth (smart surveillance) demonstrated real-world applications that connect to my coursework in bioinformatics

## Takeaways
- Seeing smart surveillance and other demos helped me connect theoretical concepts from my bioinformatics course to practical, real-world systems.
- Data Engineering practices presented at the event clarified how data pipelines and analytics enable these services.
- The visit helped me think more clearly about potential career pathways and applied projects.

## Next steps
- Explore small projects that combine bioinformatics/data-engineering techniques with real-world data pipelines (e.g., demonstrator for automated data collection → processing → dashboard).
- Follow up with contacts from UTM Digital for mentorship or internship opportunities.
- Document a short project inspired by the D RON booth to demonstrate applying course concepts in practice.
